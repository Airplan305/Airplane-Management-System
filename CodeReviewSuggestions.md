# Suggestions

## Adnan suggests to Qassim

1. Add a method that gets the flight information with the flightNumber as parameter `getFlightInfo(String flightNumber)`
2. Add a method that checks if the flight is cancelled or not that returns a boolean `isFlightCanceled(String flightNumber)`. True if canceled false if not canceled

## Qassim suggests to Adnan

1. Create a method `CancelPayment` in the payment manager that cancels a payment before a payment has been fully processed
2. Create a method to verify your phone number and email address

## Ahmed suggests to Qassim

1. In the ReservationDAO, add a new functionality `deleteReservation` that deletes the reservation by taking the reservation Id as parameter

## Adnan suggests to Ahmed

1. Add `isValidFlightTime` function that checks if the time of the flight is valid or correct.
